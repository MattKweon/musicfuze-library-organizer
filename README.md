# MusicFuze-library-organizer

A full stack JavaScript application where music enthusiasts can look up songs, save them to their library,
and create playlists to organize their music catalog.

## Why I Built This

As someone who uses Apple Music daily and loves a wide variety of music, I wanted to recreate a music library
app that allows me to easily arrange my songs based on groups such as genere, moods, artists, etc. I also used this as an opportunity to practice my backend skills by utilizing technologies like Node.js, Express, Webpack, and postgreSQL.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- React.js
- Webpack
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Express
- React Bootstrap
- [deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/guidelines)
